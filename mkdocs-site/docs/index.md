# Welcome to Dynomite

Welcome to the Dynomite wiki!

Dynomite is a generic dynamo implementation that can be used with many different key-value pair storage engines. Currently these include Redis and Memcached. Dynomite supports multi-datacenter replication and is designed for high availability.

The ultimate goal with Dynomite is to be able to implement high availability and cross-datacenter replication on storage engines that do not inherently provide that functionality. The implementation is efficient, not complex (few moving parts), and highly performant.
