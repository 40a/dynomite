Dynomite is a standalone software. However, you can leverage:
* [Dyno](https://github.com/Netflix/dyno) client for Connection pooling of persistent connections, topology aware load balancing, application resilience by intelligently failing over and falling back, flexible retry policies etc. 
* [Dynomite-manager](https://github.com/Netflix/dynomite-manager) a Dynomite sidecar for Discovery and Healthcheck, Node Configuration and Token Management for multi-region deployments, Dynomite/Redis cold bootstrap (warm up), object storage backups etc.
* [Getting started with Dynomite and Dynomite-manager](https://github.com/Netflix/dynomite-manager/wiki/Step-by-step-installation) in CentOS.
* [Dynomite-cluster-checker](https://github.com/diegopacheco/dynomite-cluster-checker) a tool maintained by [Diego Pacheco](https://github.com/diegopacheco) to validate if a Dynomite is setup properly.
